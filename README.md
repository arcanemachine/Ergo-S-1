# Ergo-S-1 Wireless Keyboard

**What Is it**
The Ergo S-1 is a fully wireless, split ergonomic keyboard that is compatible with cherry/gateron switches and cherry/oem/dcs keycaps. It runs on the fantastic ZMK firmware.

**Why Is It**
I love ergonamic keyboards. My first keyboard that I built was an Atreus, and how accessible that was for a beginner stuck with me. While I was unemployed in 2021 I spent my time designing an ergonomic keyboard that would easy for a anyone to build. 

This is te first step in acheiving that goal. The cases are designed to give you easy access to the switches for hand wiring. There's a parts list below for everything else that you'll need.

**Can You Make Me One**
While this case is open source and free for anyone to build on their own, it can be challenging to get the print just right. So I have some available in my Etsy store.

**Do You Make A Complete Kit**
Not yet, but I'm working on it! At this time you need to source switches, keycaps, and electronics from other vendors. I've included links with the recommended hardware list to make this as easy as possible.
If an (even) easier to assemble kit is something you want, let me know! I'm working as hard as I can to get that done.

**This Is Great! How Can I Help?**
The best thing you can do to help me is to share my work! The more popular this design becomes, the easier it will be for me to get to make kits or even assembled keyboards.
